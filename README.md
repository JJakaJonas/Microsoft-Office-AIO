# Microsoft-Office-AIO
This is a small project of making a Office all in one collection on a USB key with updates.
It's a project i work on in my spare time so dont expect much of it.
The goal is just to get it to work. Better code and more features will just be a plus in my book.

The Script codes will be fare from slick. 
But if you have a code uptimization i can try implement it in the program

The plan is to make it support Microsoft Office 2007 and up (currently 2021)
Theres no key gen, activater or other stuff like that.

Office 2007 and 2010 can't be obtaint in this program.

Also the ODT files are not included but needed (can be downloaded from MS. links and information on naming and placement comes when i get further in the project)
